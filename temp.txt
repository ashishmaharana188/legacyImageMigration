the s3 browser's manual search is configure dto read a set of fetched data, which is causing less search and hence the requried directories are not able to be checked.

1. we need to make sure if within 500 fetched query the search matches, if it doesnt then we keep on looping the next tokens until all files are loaded, in between this the checks for the search file also happens and result is shown if found.

check if this can be implemented with proper edge case checking
