List of things to do in the same serial order - 

NOTE: EVERYTHING IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AT App.tsx. JUST TAKE WHATEVER IS REQURIED FROM THERE AND FULLFILL MY REUIREMENTS.

1. Create folder components/action and components/UI

2. Move all function calling and handling that is happening inside APp.tsx to components/tasks. 

3. handleFileChange,handleUpload,handleSplitFiles(1 task component), handleUploadSplitFilesToS3, handleUploadToS3,handleTransferToMongo(2nd task component),handleGenerateSql,handleExecuteSql,handleupdateFolioAndTransaction(2nd task component),handleSanityCheck(4th component), s3 handleLoadMore, handleDeleteS3File,fetchS3Objects,handleDirectoryClick,handleBreadcrumbClick,handleSearch, pagination are (5th component).

4. Move all UI elements to components/UI. Similar to step 3, each task component will have its own UI component.

5. Each group or element is the button itself. Make sure the App.tsx is clean and doesnt have same duplicate code that was already migrated to other folders for clean code.

6. UI elemets use the tasks to render at App.tsx this is the flow. The App.tsx will just render the imported tasks thats all Ap.tsx will be used for.

7. Create a navigation Sidebar that opens and closes on user interation. Create Grouping for each task for UI elemets that expand and collapse when group header is clicked. Each sidebar item is a button that is clickable and opens the furhter menu for the task. We can create required buttons as per the task that is defined in this section.

8. Upload and Script(1), SQL calls and Mongo calls(2), S3 uploads, file search(3), Sanity Checks(4). (Only for UI visual grouping)

9. Each group will have icons and they if sidebar is closed only icons will be visible, if side bar is open icons+text. Use MUI Library for icons.

10. #2057A6 primary accent color. Whitesmoke is the default backgroup color. Make these and inherit everywhere.
