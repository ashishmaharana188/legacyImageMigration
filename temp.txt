The s3 broswer is not able to fetch the details. "S3BrowserTask.tsx:61 
       GET http://localhost:3001/s3-list-objects?prefix= net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED"

    Fix the s3 browser not being able to conet to s3. As a fallback to reload the connection for s3 component without reloading the full server please add a reload button that reload the connection to s3 in s3browser component.
